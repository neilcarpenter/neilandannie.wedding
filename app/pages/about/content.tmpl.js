  <h1>So you guys are getting married?!</h1>
  <p>Yep! After 10 amazing years together, we’ve decided we’d quite like to stay this way.</p>
  <p>We’ll be doing the legal bit a few days before (with immediate family only) so we can have a really relaxed and personal ceremony with all the people we love at the Great Barn.</p>
  <p>We can't wait to celebrate with you all!</p>

  <h4>What’s happening on the day?</h4>
  <p>The ceremony starts at 1.30pm, and will either be outside in the orchard or in the barn (fingers crossed for sunshine!). </p>
  <p>After the ceremony we’ll have canapes and drinks in the orchard, then we'll sit down for dinner at 4pm.</p>
  <p>Following the speeches, the party starts around 6.30pm and ends at 11.30pm. Everyone has to leave the venue by midnight!</p>

  <h4>Can I bring my kids?</h4>
  <p>As much as we love your kiddies, unfortunately we are unable to invite them to our wedding. The only children at our day will be our gorgeous nieces and nephews.</p>

  <h4>Can I park my car at The Great Barn?</h4>
  <p>Yes, there is a free car park in the field next to the barn.</p>

  <h4>How do I find The Great Barn?</h4>
  <p>From the centre of Rolvenden take the A28 towards Tenterden. Just beyond the end of the 30mph limit turn Left into Halden Lane, the turning for which is adjacent to a row of houses. Drive for 1½ miles to the first farm on the Right, Halden Place (opposite Leyton House). Check the <a href="/when-where">When & Where page</a> for the full address.</p>
