  <h1>So you guys are getting married?!</h1>
  <p>We sure are!</p>
  <p>We’ll be doing the legal bit a few days before (with immediate family only) so we can have a really relaxed and personal ceremony with all the people we love at the Great Barn.</p>
  <p>We can't wait to celebrate with you all!</p>

  <h4>Do I need to bring cash?</h4>
  <p>There will be a cash bar in the evening, we can't guarantee the bar will be able to take card payments due to phone signal in the area, so strongly recommend bringing cash instead.</p>

  <h4>How should I get to / from the venue?</h4>
  <p>Due to the ruralness of the venue, you will need to make sure you sort your travel arrangements in advance, such as booking taxis. There is a list of numbers below, or if you have any questions just email us.</p>
  <p>Anyone that has requested a minibus for the evening, this has all been booked, please remember to bring £7 per person on the day. If you would like to be booked on the minibus but have not told us yet, please let us know ASAP so we can update the booking, as there won't be any extra spaces on the day!</p>

  <h4>How should I let you know that I am coming?</h4>
  <p>Please RSVP via the form on the <a href="/rsvp">RSVP page</a>, alternatively if that isn't working for you, you can email Neil on <a href="mailto:neilanthonycarpenter@gmail.com">neilanthonycarpenter@gmail.com</a> or Annie on <a href="mailto:anniereilly87@gmail.com">anniereilly87@gmail.com</a>.</p>
  <p><b>Please RSVP by Friday 23rd December</b> so we can plan accordingly! :)</p>

  <h4>Can I bring my kids? Can I bring a plus one?</h4>
  <p>Unfortunately there is limited space at the barn so we can't accommodate +1s or kids, check your invitation if you're not sure who is invited.</p>

  <h4>Can I park my car at The Great Barn?</h4>
  <p>Yes, there is a free car park in the field next to the barn.</p>

  <h4>How do I find The Great Barn?</h4>
  <p>By train: The nearest station to the barn is Headcorn, which is approximately 15 minutes away by car. Trains run there regularly from London Charing Cross, Waterloo or London Bridge and take just over an hour.</p>
  <p>If you're driving: From the centre of Rolvenden take the A28 towards Tenterden. Just beyond the end of the 30mph limit turn Left into Halden Lane, the turning for which is adjacent to a row of houses. Drive for 1½ miles to the first farm on the Right, Halden Place (opposite Leyton House).</p>
  <p>Check the <a href="/when-where">When & Where page</a> for the full address.</p>

  <h4>Can I get a taxi to the venue?</h4>
